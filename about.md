PL/SQL extends Oracle's implementation of SQL to allow for procederual elements like loops and conditionals. Together with SQL and Java it forms the toolbox that is availabe within the Oracle database environment. PL/SQL can only be executed within the Oracle DBMS. 

Packages (basically functions) can be stored within the DBMS and called in SQL. Similarly PL/SQL can execute regular SQL. 

PL/SQL is commonly used to make an API into the database, or to perform extract/transact/load functions on data.
